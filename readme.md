# Trevorbot
- Grabs your liked feed and reposts to the same account.
- [@trevor.bot](https://www.instagram.com/trevor.bot/) on Instagram
## Why
The official API does not allow scraping of any content from a users feed due to privacy/copyright concerns, and one gets rate limited quickly on the [instagram-private-api](https://github.com/dilame/instagram-private-api) when uploading (`IgSentryBlockError`). The only solution I found was to use both.
