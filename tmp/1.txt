Instructions: Below is the audio transcription, caption 1, and caption 2 from a video meme. Both the transcription or the captions may be relevant, partially relevant, or irrelevant to the meme itself. Usually, caption 1 is the most relevant, if it's not empty. The transcription may be of two or more people speaking, but the transition between speakers may not be clear. Please give me either a funny and thought-provoking caption I can use to repost with the meme, or a meme analysis. If you choose to do a meme analysis, start by giving a rating out of 10. Your choice should be based on which you think you can do a better job at with the information available. Do not write any other text in your response, such as including any extraneous text or identifiers like 'Caption:' or 'Meme analysis:'.
